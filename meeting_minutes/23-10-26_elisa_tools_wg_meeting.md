## Discussion Topics

* Prioritizing Discussion Topics
  * Non-negotiable: Revising/broadening the Working Group mission statement
  * Other Topics
    * ELISA CI
      * How can we contribute to / expand the ELISA CI?
    * Engagement
      * How do we increase engagement with this group?
      * How do we directly tie our work to Vertical WGs?
      * How do we directly help maintainers?
      * How do we engage on peoples *actual* daily problems?
    * Static Analysis in Open Source SW
      * How should we approach it?
        * Do we (and if so how?) reconcile OSS coding standards with Certification coding standards
      * How can we contribute?
        * Contribute to clang-tidy / clang-format?
    * Kernel testing
      * Can we contribute to kernel testing in a systematic way?
    * Tool Qualification
      * What are the similarities/differences of Tool Qualification across industries?
      * How we do approach qualification of OSS tools?
    * clang compatibility
      * Can we use clang in Yocto as an alternative to GCC
    * Rust
      * No particularly interesting, maybe future topic?

## Discussion Notes

* Current Mission Statement:
  * "The Tool Investigation and Code Improvement WG focuses on application of tools, handling the tool results, and improving the kernel based on the toolsâ€™ feedback.
  * Qasim: We can add tools which make things easier and adding configuration per earlier
  * Matt: Change "tools" to "techniques" such that it could including testing
  * Matt: Scratch "based on the tools feedback"
    * "Improving the kernel to enable it's use in safety cases"??
    * This could including increasing the configurability of the kernel to get only what is relevant to your use case

  * Current Proposal: "The Tool Investigation and Code Improvement WG focuses on creation, analysis, and application of techniques to contribute to the improvement of the kernel for use in safety cases."
  
* Qasim/Matt: There is a barrier to entry to ALL groups but especially the industry groups
  * How can we improve documentation for newcomers so that it is easy for the to participate in the next conversation!
* Qasim/Matt: There is a fear factor to submitting your first patch anywhere or jumping into a mailing list for the first time!
  * The prior group did great working getting people setup via active meetings but we need to create better documentation for newcomers
* Qasim: Linux Foundation Course 103 on guide on how to create patches
* Matt: Interested in being part of the broader OSS community
* Matt: Boeing making a big push to make Linux viable for aerospace safety use-cases
* Matt: Background in the tools required for aerospace compliance
* Matt: Want to broaden the mission statement beyond "contributing to Linux" to "contributing to Linux to improve the safety case"
* Matt: Very interesting in contributing additional kernel configuration options to make a smaller kernel possible (to help safety)
* Matt: Very interested in increasing kernel code testing coverage
* Qasim: Open source static analysis tools for Linux
  * https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/index.html
  * Kernel documentation lists coccinelle, sparse, and smatch
  * Can we qualify those tools for use in safety (aerospace, automotive)?s
* Qasim: How will we test and validate the addition of configuration options to the kernel?
  
## Round Table

## Action Items

* [] Matt: Bring up engagement (present to vertical groups? blog post? presenting November summary meeting) at the TSC
* [] Matt: Create proposal for broader WG mission statement
* [] Matt: Model wg-tools README.md after wg-automative to educate newcomers quickly
* [] Matt: Contact Sudip/Lukas to pull together documentation on patch submission
* [] Qasim: Explore the open source static analysis tools
* [] Qasim: Understand clang static analysis tools (clang-tidy/clang-analyzer)
